<p>
	Hi there, I'm a progammer based in Isfahan, Iran - 
	endlessly curious, easily distracted by intriguing problems, and mostly up for a challenge.
</p>
<p>
	I'm fascinated by
	<span style="color: #e36f6f;">o</span>pen-source <span style="color: #e36f6f;">s</span>oftware,
	<span style="color: #6fe3df;">s</span>ystems <span style="color: #6fe3df;">p</span>rogramming,
	and <span style="color: #9a6fe3;">t</span>ooling & <span style="color: #c06fe3">t</span>inkering
	- the kind of things that make hours disappear without noticing.
</p>
<p>
	An unquenchable thirst drives me to venture in the world of forms - 
	the kind that starts with a question and ends three rabbit holes later.
</p>
<p>
	Currently I'm working on my <span style="color: #84e36f;">p</span>ersonal
	<span style="color: #84e36f;">d</span>evelopment <span style="color: #84e36f;">e</span>cosystem,
	and brushing up on my <span style="color: #e36fa1;">w</span>eb
	<span style="color: #e36fa1;">d</span>evelopment skills.
</p>
<p>
	Anyhow, let's get going with the professional button-pressing and make a difference, shall we?
